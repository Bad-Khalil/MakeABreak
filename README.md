# Make A Break
A small app that I use for myself to make enough breaks between my work.

I noticed that my productivity and general health improved enormously after I introduced regular breaks.

"Make a Break" really supports my workflow and maybe you are also interested and want to contribute to it?

In addition to the features, it was important to me to use pure js with jQuery to get a variety from today's frontend technologies (e.g. React JS).

Maybe later I'll rewrite the app in Vue or React to show how much easier it is to use these technologies.

The app is available on Windows and Mac.
